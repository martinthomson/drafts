1.  Introduction

   RFC 4572 [RFC4572] describes how the fingerprint Session Description
   Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566] attribute binds a session description to an
   X.509 certificate [X509].  Unfortunately, the only statement it makes
   regarding multiple fingerprints is the following:

      A certificate fingerprint MUST be computed using the same one-way
      hash function as is used in the certificate's signature algorithm.

   This has the unfortunate consequence of unnecessarily coupling the
   security properties of the certificate to the hash function used in
   signing the certificate.  To maximize the chances of a certificate
   being accepted, the hash algorithm used in certificates tends to lag
   current best practice, potentially exposing sessions to attacks based
   on hash collision.

   The ability to use stronger cryptographic hash algorithms (hash
   agility) improves the integrity of the binding between the session
   description and the entity in possession of the private key.  Systems
   that rely on other bindings to the session (or the private keys used
   to establish it) do not benefit from these changes.

   This document also describes an optional mechanism that might be used
   to identify multiple certificates, in cases where the offered
   certificate might be selected from a small set.  This might have
   operational advantages where the endpoint answering a call is not
   known ahead of a session description being created.

Internet-Draft        SDP Certificate Fingerprints          October 2013


1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   At times, this document falls back on shorthands for establishing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  These terms are defined in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Hash Agility

   The SDP fingerprint attribute is used to indicate the hash of the
   certificate - a certificate fingerprint - that is offered in the TLS
   [RFC5246] or DTLS [RFC5764] handshake.  The certificate fingerprint
   so included is used to bind the (D)TLS session to the session
   description.

   Multiple fingerprint attributes can be used to identify a certificate
   using alternative cryptographic hash algorithms.  This allows
   sessions descriptions to use alternative, potentially stronger, hash
   algorithms without risking interoperability failure.  A stronger hash
   algorithm is more resistant to collision attacks, which can be used
   to impersonate endpoints.

   To avoid cases where certificate fingerprints cannot be validated,
   implementations MUST support SHA-256 [FIPS2].  That is, a fingerprint
   attribute using SHA-256 MUST be included in any place that includes
   fingerprint attributes and implementations MUST be able to validate
   SHA-256 fingerprints.

   Implementations or specific applications can specify that validation
   using a different hash algorithm be mandatory in order to achieve a
   desired level of collision resistance.  Implementations MUST NOT
   consider a session binding to be valid unless a certificate
   fingerprint using sufficiently strong hash algorithm matches one in
   the session description.  For example, an application might specify
   that certificates are validated using SHA-384 [FIPS2] in addition to,
   or instead of, SHA-256.

   Additional fingerprint attributes MAY be included using alternative
   hash algorithms.  An endpoint that validates a session using
   fingerprint attributes MUST report failure if any hash that it checks
   doesn't match.

   Endpoints can ignore fingerprint attributes that use hash algorithms
   it doesn't support or wish to validate.

3.  Multiple Certificates

   It might be that an application desires the ability to create session
   descriptions where the security context can be terminated using one
   of a small set of certificates.

   An endpoint that validates a session description with multiple values
   for the same hash algorithm MUST fail the validation unless a
   fingerprint matches for each hash algorithm validated.  Therefore, a
   session description that includes multiple a=fingerprint values for
   the same hash algorithm MUST include the same number of a=fingerprint
   values for every hash algorithm that is included.

4.  Security Considerations

   Over time, advances in cryptanalysis and computational power render
   hash algorithms increasingly prone to collision attacks.  A hash
   collision on a certificate fingerprint would allow for impersonation.
   This document describes how to use different hash algorithms,
   independent of those selected for use in certificates.

   Hash agility does not reduce the need for session description
   integrity protection or any of the suggested supporting mechanisms
   described in [RFC4572].

   Adding support for hash agility does not affect the properties gained
   through the use of other mechanisms like the use of other bindings
   between session and identity.  This document only improves the
   binding between a session and its description in SDP.  For example,
   mechanisms such as the one described in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch] require the implementation of
   equivalent processing rules to benefit from hash agility.  Systems
   relying on the X.509 certificate chain to a specific trust anchor are
   similarly unaffected.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
