1.  Introduction

   The resolution of HTTP URIs [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging] provides
   no security guarantees whatsoever.  This document describes a
   mechanism that would grant a measure of protection against passive
   monitoring by opportunistically using Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   [RFC5246].

   This document describes a ways that alternative services
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-alt-svc] can be used in combination with HTTP/2
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2] or HTTP/1.1 [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p1-messaging]
   over TLS [RFC2818] to resolve HTTP URIs using TLS.

   A secondary method is defined where clients opportunistically use a
   connection to port 443.

   A strawman proposal that enables some protection against active
   attacks, is included in Section 5.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   At times, this document falls back on shorthands for establishing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  These terms are defined in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Alternative Services

   A server that supports the resolution of HTTP URIs can provide an
   alternative service advertisement [I-D.ietf-httpbis-alt-svc] for a

   protocol that uses TLS, such as "h2" ([I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2]), or
   "http/1.1" ([RFC2818]).

   A client that sees this advertisement can direct future requests for
   the associated origin to the alternative service.

   A client that places the importance of passive protections over
   performance might choose to send no further requests over cleartext
   connections if it detects the alternative service advertisement.  If
   the alternative service cannot be successfully connected, the client
   might resume its use of the cleartext connection.

   A client can also explicitly probe for an alternative service
   advertisement by sending a request that bears little or no sensitive
   information, such as one with the "OPTIONS" method.  Clients with
   expired alternative services information could make a similar request
   in parallel to an attempt to contact an alternative service, to
   minimize the delays that might be incurred by failing to contact the
   alternative service.

3.  Detecting Alternatives by Inference

   A client that resolves an HTTP URI that does not explicitly include a
   port (for example, "http://example.com/en/index.html") MAY attempt to
   send requests for that resource to TCP port 443 using either HTTP/2
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2] or HTTP/1.1 over TLS [RFC2818].

   A client can take an inability to establish a TCP connection on port
   443 or a 421 status code (see [I-D.ietf-httpbis-alt-svc]) as a strong
   signal that the server does not support requests for HTTP URIs on
   this port.

   A server that provides a 404 or 501 status code could be unable to
   service requests for HTTP URIs over TLS.  Clients SHOULD avoid
   sending further requests for HTTP URIs over TLS to that server.

4.  Server Authentication

   There are no expectations with respect to security when it comes to
   resolving HTTP URIs.  Requiring server authentication, as described
   in [RFC2818], creates a number of deployment challenges.

   When connecting to a service, clients do not perform the server
   authentication procedure described in Section 3.1 of [RFC2818].  A
   server is therefore able to provide any certificate, or even select
   TLS cipher suites that do not include authentication.

   A client MAY perform additional checks on the certificate that it is
   offered (if the server does not select an unauthenticated TLS cipher
   suite).  For instance, a client could examine the certificate to see
   if it has changed over time.

4.1.  Interaction with HTTPS URIs

   A service that is discovered to support HTTP URIs might concurrently
   support HTTPS URIs.  If a connection is initially created without
   authenticating the server, requests for HTTPS resources cannot be
   sent over that connection until the server certificate is
   successfully authenticated (as described in Section 3.1 of
   [RFC2818]).

5.  Persisting use of TLS

   [[Open Issue: it seems desirable that this could become sticky to
   avoid downgrade attacks.  Here's a strawman proposal for dealing with
   that.]]

   Two factors ensure that active attacks are trivial to mount:

   o  A client that doesn't perform authentication is easily made victim
      of server impersonation.

   o  A client that is willing to use cleartext to resolve the resource
      will do so if access to any TLS-enabled alternative services is
      blocked at the network layer.

   Both of these issues can be limited by having a server make a
   commitment to providing service over TLS in future requests.  A
   server makes this commitment by sending a "HTTP-TLS" header field.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   Cache-Control: 600
   Age: 30
   Date: Thu, 1 May 2014 16:20:09 GMT
   HTTP-TLS: ma=3600

   A client that has has not authenticated the server MAY do so when it
   sees the "HTTP-TLS" header field.  The procedure described in
   Section 3.1 of [RFC2818] MUST be used, without regard to the value of
   the alternative services.  If server authentication is successful,
   the client can persistently store a record that the requested origin
   [RFC6454] can be retrieved over TLS.

      HTTP-TLS     = 1#parameter

   Persisted information expires after a period determined by the value
   of the "ma" parameter.  See Section 4.2.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-httpbis-p6-cache] for details of determining response age.

      ma-parameter     = delta-seconds

   Requests for an origin that has a persisted, unexpired value for
   "HTTP-TLS" MUST fail if they cannot be made over TLS.

   Once a server has indicated that it will support authenticated TLS, a
   client MAY use key pinning [I-D.ietf-websec-key-pinning] or any other
   mechanism that would otherwise be restricted to use with HTTPS URIs,
   provided that the mechanism can be restricted to a single HTTP
   origin.

6.  Security Considerations

   The basic mechanisms here do absolutely nothing against an active
   attack.  Section 5 describes a system whereby return business can be
   protected from active attack.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Register HTTP-TLS if it makes sense to do so.
