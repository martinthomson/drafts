1.  Introduction

   Anyone who uses HTTP [RFC2616] without TLS [RFC5246] (i.e., HTTPS
   [RFC2818]) runs a very real risk of being pwned.

   This document attempts to remedy this by prohibiting the use of the
   "http:" scheme.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   In cases where normative language needs to be emphasized, this
   document falls back on established shorthands for expressing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  The meaning of these
   is described in [RFC2119].

2.  MUST NOT use http:

   HTTP clients and servers MUST NOT access or provide resources over
   unsecured HTTP.  Thus, resources identified with "http:" URIs cannot
   be used.

3.  Why Not Opportunistically Encrypt?

   Opportunistic encryption is fine if your adversary isn't on-path.
   It's pretty ineffectual if your adversary is able to interspose
   themselves somehow.  There is now evidence to suggest that
   interception capabilities are less difficult to achieve than
   originally thought.

4.  Why Not Trust on First Use?

   TOFU is unsatisfactory.  It is effectively a pin for the lifetime of
   a certificate, which raises several issues:

   o  Key rollover cannot occur without exposure to an active attack, or
      some form of succession plan.  The typical key pinning succession
      plan involves providing alternative pins under the protection of a
      trusted certificate.  This sort of plan cannot be enacted without
      a lead time of at least equal to the pin duration.  The successor
      key has to be available for this entire period.

      From an operational perspective, this is difficult.  In order to
      ensure that the risk of loss, exposure, or exfiltration of the
      private key for the successor, the private key for the successor
      needs to be backed up and stored offline.  Any service that is
      unwilling to obtain third-party validation of their certificates
      seems unlikely to be inclined to perform this step.

   o  Pinning makes it difficult to scale out services without sharing
      of private keys.  Clients will reject connections that offer
      private keys other than the one they first see.

5.  Why Not Externalize the Consequences?

   That's what we've been doing for years.  That turned out to be a
   political nightmare once people found out.

6.  Security Considerations

   The IETF has partnered with several large organizations to perform
   enforcement.  Users of "http:" URIs will be pwned.  Operators of
   sites that offer "http:" resources will be pwned.
