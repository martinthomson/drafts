   use in identifying Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) usages of
   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).  Labels are provided for
   identifying a session that uses a combination of WebRTC compatible
   media and data, and for identifying a session requiring
   confidentiality protection.

1.  Introduction

   Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview] uses
   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) [RFC6347] to secure all
   peer-to-peer communications.

   Identifying WebRTC protocol usage with Application Layer Protocol
   Negotiation (ALPN) [RFC7301] enables an endpoint to positively
   identify WebRTC uses and distinguish them from other DTLS uses.

   Different WebRTC uses can be advertised and behavior can be
   constrained to what is appropriate to a given use.  In particular,
   this allows for the identifications of sessions that require
   confidentiality protection.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   At times, this document falls back on shorthands for establishing
   interoperability requirements on implementations: the capitalized
   words "MUST", "SHOULD" and "MAY".  These terms are defined in
   [RFC2119].

2.  ALPN Labels for WebRTC

   The following identifiers are defined for use in ALPN:

   webrtc:  The DTLS session is used to establish keys for a Secure
      Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) - known as DTLS-SRTP - as
      described in [RFC5764].  The DTLS record layer is used for WebRTC
      data channels [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

   c-webrtc:  The DTLS session is used for confidential WebRTC
      communications, where peers agree to maintain the confidentiality
      of the communications, as described in Section 3.

   Both identifiers describe the same basic protocol: a DTLS session
   that is used to provide keys for an SRTP session in combination with
   WebRTC data channels.  Either SRTP or data channels MAY be absent.
   The data channels send Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)
   [RFC4960] over the DTLS record layer, which can be multiplexed with
   SRTP on the same UDP flow.  WebRTC requires the use of Interactive
   Communication Establishment (ICE) [RFC5245] to establish the UDP
   flow, but this is not covered by the identifier.

   A more thorough definition of what WebRTC communications entail is
   included in [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-transports].

   There is no functional difference between the identifiers except that
   an endpoint negotiating "c-webrtc" makes a promise to preserve the
   confidentiality of the data it receives.

   A peer that is not aware of whether it needs to request
   confidentiality can use either form.  A peer in the client role MUST
   offer both identifiers if it is not aware of a need for
   confidentiality.  A peer in the server role SHOULD select "webrtc" if
   it does not prefer either.

3.  Media Confidentiality

   Private communications in WebRTC depend on separating control (i.e.,
   signaling) capabilities and access to media
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch].  In this way, an application can
   establish a session that is end-to-end confidential, where the ends
   in question are user agents (or browsers) and not the signaling
   application.

   A browser is required to enforce this control using isolation
   controls similar to those used in cross-origin protections.  These
   protections ensure that media is protected from applications.
   Applications are not able to read or modify the contents of a
   protected flow of media.  Media that is produced from a session using
   the "c-webrtc" identifier MUST only be displayed to users.

   Without some form of indication that is securely bound to the
   session, a WebRTC endpoint is unable to properly distinguish between
   session that requires confidentiality protection and one that does
   not.

   A browser is required to enforce confidentiality using isolation
   controls similar to those used in content cross-origin protections
   (see Section 5.3 [1] of [HTML5]).  These protections ensure that
   media is protected from applications.  Applications are not able to
   read or modify the contents of a protected flow of media.  Media that
   is produced from a session using the "c-webrtc" identifier MUST only
   be displayed to users.

   These confidentiality protections do not apply to data that is sent
   using data channels.  Confidential data depends on having both data
   sources and consumers that are exclusively browser- or user-based.
   No mechanisms currently exist to take advantage of data
   confidentiality, though some use cases suggest that this could be
   useful, for example, confidential peer-to-peer file transfer.
   Alternative labels might be provided in future to support these use
   cases.

   Generally speaking, ensuring confidentiality depends on
   authenticating the communications peer.  This mechanism explicitly
   does not define a specific authentication method; a WebRTC endpoint
   that accepts a session with this ALPN identifier MUST respect
   confidentiality no matter what identity is attributed to a peer.

   RTP middleboxes and entities that forward media or data cannot
   promise to maintain confidentiality.  Any entity that forwards
   content, or records content for later access by entities other than
   the authenticated peer, SHOULD NOT offer or accept a session with the
   "c-webrtc" identifier.

4.  Security Considerations

   Confidential communications depends on more than just an agreement
   from browsers.

   Information is not confidential if it is displayed to those other
   than to whom it is intended.  Peer authentication
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch] is necessary to ensure that data is
   only sent to the intended peer.

   This is not a digital rights management mechanism.  Even with an
   authenticated peer, a user is not prevented from using other
   mechanisms to record or forward media.  This means that (for example)
   screen recording devices, tape recorders, portable cameras, or a
   cunning arrangement of mirrors could variously be used to record or
   redistribute media once delivered.  Similarly, if media is visible or
   audible (or otherwise accessible) to others in the vicinity, there
   are no technical measures that protect the confidentiality of that
   media.  In other cases, effects might not be temporally localized:

   transmitted smells could linger for a period after communications
   cease.

   The only guarantee provided by this mechanism and the browser that
   implements it is that the media was delivered to the user that was
   authenticated.  Individual users will still need to make a judgment
   about how their peer intends to respect the confidentiality of any
   information provided.

   On a shared computing platform like a browser, other entities with
   access to that platform (i.e., web applications), might be able to
   access information that would compromise the confidentiality of
   communications.  Implementations MAY choose to limit concurrent
   access to input devices during confidential communications session.

   For instance, another application that is able to access a microphone
   might be able to sample confidential audio that is playing through
   speakers.  This is true even if acoustic echo cancellation, which
   attempts to prevent this from happening, is used.  Similarly, an
   application with access to a video camera might be able to use
   reflections to obtain all or part of a confidential video stream.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The following two entries are added to the "Application Layer
   Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) Protocol IDs" registry established by
   [RFC7301].

   The "webrtc" identifies mixed media and data communications using
   SRTP and data channels:

   Protocol:  WebRTC Media and Data

   Identification Sequence:  0x77 0x65 0x62 0x72 0x74 0x63 ("webrtc")

   Specification:  This document (RFCXXXX)

   The "c-webrtc" identifies confidential WebRTC communications:

   Protocol:  Confidential WebRTC Media and Data

   Identification Sequence:  0x63 0x2d 0x77 0x65 0x62 0x72 0x74 0x63
      ("c-webrtc")

   Specification:  This document (RFCXXXX)
