               Expressing Confidence in a Location Object
                draft-thomson-geopriv-confidence-latest

Abstract

   A confidence element is described that expresses the estimated
   probability that the associated location information is correct.
   This element conveys information that might otherwise be lost about
   the probability distribution represented by a region of uncertainty.

1.  Introduction

   Location information is often less than perfect.  Two measures are
   used to quantify how imperfect the location information is:
   uncertainty and confidence.  These terms, and their relationship with
   location information are explored in detail in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty].  Standard forms for the expression
   of uncertainty are included in [RFC5491], but confidence is fixed to
   a value of 95%.

   On the whole, a fixed definition for confidence ensures consistency
   between implementations.  Location generators that are aware of this
   constraint can generate location information at the required
   confidence.  Location recipients are able to make sensible
   assumptions about the quality of the information that they receive.

   In some circumstances - particularly with pre-existing systems -
   location generators might provide location information with some
   other confidence.  Common values include 38%, 67% and 90%; all of
   which are prevalent in current systems.  Existing forms of expressing
   location information, such as that defined in [TS-3GPP-23_032],
   contain elements that express the confidence in the result.

   The addition of a confidence element provides information that was
   previously unavailable to recipients of location information.
   Without this information, a location server or generator that has
   access to location information with a confidence lower than 95% has
   two options:

   o  The location server can scale regions of uncertainty in an attempt
      to acheive 95% confidence.  This scaling process significantly
      degrades the quality of the information, because the location
      server might not have the necessary information to scale
      appropriately; the location server is forced to make assumptions
      that are likely result in either an overly conservative estimate
      with high uncertainty or a overestimate of confidence.

   o  The location server can ignore the confidence entirely, which
      results in giving the recipient a false impression of its quality.

   Both of these choices degrade the quality of the information
   provided.

   The addition of a confidence element avoids this problem entirely if
   a location recipient supports and understands the element.  A
   recipient that does not understand, and hence ignores, the confidence
   element is in no worse a position than if the location server ignored
   confidence.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document relies on the definitions in
   [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty] and [RFC3693].

2.  Representation of Confidence in PIDF-LO

   The confidence element MAY be added to the "location-info" element of
   the Presence Information Data Format - Location Object (PIDF-LO)
   [RFC4119] document.  This element expresses the confidence in the
   associated location information as a percentage.

   The confidence element optionally includes an attribute that
   indicates the shape of the probability density function (PDF) of the
   associated region of uncertainty.  Three values are possible:
   unknown, normal and rectangular.

   Indicating a particular PDF only indicates that the distribution
   approximately fits the given shape based on the methods used to
   generate the location information.  The PDF is normal if there are a
   large number of small, independent sources of error; rectangular if
   all points within the area have roughly equal probability of being
   the actual location of the Target; otherwise, the PDF MUST either be
   set to unknown or omitted.

Internet-Draft                 Confidence                   October 2013


   If a PIDF-LO does not include the confidence element, confidence is
   95% [RFC5491].  A Point shape does not have uncertainty (or it has
   infinite uncertainty), so confidence is meaningless for a point;
   therefore, this element MUST be omitted if only a point is provided.

2.1.  Generating Locations with Confidence

   Location generators SHOULD attempt to ensure that confidence is equal
   in each dimension when generating location information.  This
   restriction, while not always practical, allows for more accurate
   scaling, if scaling is necessary.

   Confidence MUST NOT be included unless location information cannot be
   acquired with 95% confidence.

2.2.  Consuming and Presenting Confidence

   The inclusion of confidence that is anything other than 95% presents
   a potentially difficult usability for applications that use location
   information.  Effectively communicating the probability that a
   location is incorrect to a user can be difficult.

   It is inadvisable to simply display locations of any confidence, or
   to display confidence in a separate or non-obvious fashion.  If
   locations with different confidence levels are displayed such that
   the distinction is subtle or easy to overlook - such as using fine
   graduations of color or transparency for graphical uncertainty
   regions, or displaying uncertainty graphically, but providing
   confidence as supplementary text - a user could fail to notice a
   difference in the quality of the location information that might be
   significant.

   Depending on the circumstances, different ways of handling confidence
   might be appropriate.  [I-D.thomson-geopriv-uncertainty] describes
   techniques that could be appropriate for consumers that use automated
   processing as well as background on the issue.

   Providing that the full implications of any choice for the
   application are understood, some amount of automated processing could
   be appropriate.  In a simple example, applications could choose to
   discard or suppress the display of location information if confidence
   does not meet a pre-determined threshold.

   In settings where there is an opportunity for user training, some of
   these problems might be mitigated by defining different operational
   procedures for handling location information at different confidence
   levels.

3.  Example

   The PIDF-LO document in Figure 1 includes a representation of
   uncertainty as a circular area.  The confidence element (on the line
   marked with a comment) indicates that the confidence is 67% and that
   it follows a normal distribution.
