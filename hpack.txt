HTTP/2 adds a compression feature for HTTP header fields.  HTTP requests carry a lot of redundant
information and compression shows significant improvements.

Compression creates a potential attack vector on the protocol.  CRIME demonstrated that a general
purpose compressor (gzip in this case) can be exploited, with a practical attack being demonstrated
on SPDY, the predecessor of HTTP/2.
